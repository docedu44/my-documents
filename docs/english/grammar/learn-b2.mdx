برای بیان آرزو استفاده می شود و در 3 زمان گذشته، حال و آینده استفاده می شود.

### جملات آرزویی در زمان حال
برای بیان نارضایتی از وضعیت موجود و تمایل به تغییر شرایط در زمان حال استفاده می شود.

ساختار جملات آرزویی در زمان حال:

`شکل گذشته قعل + فاعل + I wish`
```text

I wish he were rich now.
I can't come. I wish I could come.

```
🎉 می توانیم برای همه ضمائر فاعلی از `were` استفاده کنیم.

### جملات آرزویی در زمان آینده
برای بیان نارضایتی از وضعیت آینده و تمایل برای تغییر شرایط در زمان آینده کاربرد دارد.

ساختار جملات آرزویی در زمان آینده:

`شکل ساده قعل + would + فاعل + I wish`
```text

I wish it would stop raining. => ای کاش باران قطع شود
I wish he wouldn't come here next week.
He's not arrived yet. I wish he would hurry up.
I wish you would listen to me.
I wish you would stop making so much noise.
```

### جملات آرزویی در زمان گذشته
برای بیان پشیمانی و تاسف از عمل یا وضعیتی در گذشته

We mustn't miss the train. it's the last one tonight.

```
روش منفی کردن:

1. فعل `must` => با اضافه کردن `not`
2. فعل `have to` => با استفاده از `don't / doesn't`

🎉 ما می توانیم بجای `have to` از `have got to` نیز استفاده کنیم:
```text
I must stop smoking.
I have got to stop smoking.

You mustn't park your car here. => تو نباید ماشینت را اینجا پارک کنی
You don't have to park your car here. تو مجبور نیستی ماشینت را اینجا پارک کنی
```

```

## ترتیب قرارگیری صفات (Order of adjectives)
استفاده از حداکثر 3 یا 4 صفت برای یک اسم متداول است و ترتیب قرارگیری صفات باید اصولی و منظم باشد.

```text

```
روش تبدیل سوالات `yes/no question` به جمله واره های اسمی:

1. با فعل کمکی `do` شروع شود:

حذف `do` و قرار دادن `if / whether` به جای آن
```text

ممکن است به من بگویی که آیا آن ها انگلیسی می خوانند ؟

```
3. با فعل کمکی `did` شروع شود:

من مطمئن نیستم که آیا او یک معلم است.
```
روش تبدیل سوالات `wh` دار به جمله وار های اسمی:

همانند روش سوالات `yes / no question` باید عمل کنیم.

نیازی به اضافه کردن `if / whether` نیست.
```text

Can you tell me where you work ? => ممکن است به من بگویی کجا کار می کنی؟
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```
🎉 باید حواسمان باشد ک جمله واره ها سوالی نیستند، پس هنگام استفاده باید ب جایگاه فعل و فاعل دقت شود و قسمت دوم جمله را ب صورت سوالی ک اول فعل است ننویسیم.

🎉 در `wh` دار ها باید در جمله واره ها فعل را در انتها استفاده کرد

## صحبت در مورد عادات گذشته (Past habits)
از `used to` و `would` برای صحبت در مورد عادت گذشته استفاده می شود.
```text
When we were children, my brother and I used to fight all the time.

When we were children, my brother and I would fight all the time.
```
🎉 اصولا بعد از `used to` فعل به صورت شکل ساده می آید.

🎉 هنگام استفاده از `would`، ارجاع به زمان گذشته ضروری است.
```text
Before I got this job, I used to go out a lot. ✔
Before I got this job, I would go out a lot. ✔

I used to go out a lot. ✔
I would go out a lot. ✖
```
اما برای `used to` می توان بدون ارجاع ب زمان گذشته هم آن را نوشت.
### انواع فعل در زبان انگلیسی
1. **افعال کنشی**

بیان کننده عمل یا کار هستند.
```text
eat / walk / learn / sleep
```
2. **افعال حالتی**

بیان کننده حالت هستند.
```text
love / hate / know / live
```
🎉 هنگام استفاده از `would`، فقط از **افعال کنشی** می توانیم استفاده کنیم.
```text
She used to have a long hair.
She would have a long hair. ✖

My dad would always read to me before bed.
When they came to London, they would never travel anywhere on the tube.
```
اما از `used to` می توان برای هر 2 نوع فعل استفاده کرد.

```text
I didn't use to work there.
He didn't use to play soccer.

Did you use to smoke ?
Did he use to sleep late ?

🎉 باید حواسمان باشد ک بعد از ضمائر موصولی، نباید ضمیر اسمی ک در جمله اصلی است را دوباره بیاوریم، یعنی بعد از ضمائر موصولی، فعل قرار می گیرد و خود آن ضمائر موصولی کار ضمیر اصلی را انجام می دهند.

## حروف ربط ( Conjunctions) 2
